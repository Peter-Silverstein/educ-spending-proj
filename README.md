# STATGR5293 Final Project

Authors: Peter Silverstein and Sam Gartenstein

## Project Description

The goal of our project is to understand how state-level education spending is influenced by political trifectasâ€”situations where a single party controls the Governorship, Senate, and House of Representatives within a state. Specifically, we examine how education budgets change under unified versus divided government control across states and over time. Using data on state education per-pupil spending (adjusted to 2016 dollars) from 1997 to 2013, we employ multilevel models that account for demographic and economic factors, as well as fixed effects for state and year.
